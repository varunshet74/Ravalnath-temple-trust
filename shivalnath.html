    <h2>Shivalnath</h2>
    <p><strong>Shivalnath</strong> does not have as prominent individual documentation as Ravalnath, but is frequently considered another regional or local form linked to Lord Shiva. The name likely points to an epithet or aspect of Shiva, symbolizing both his supreme creative power and lion-like strength (“Nath” meaning Lord; “Shiva” the destroyer and transformer in the Hindu trinity).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shivalnath is viewed as an aspect or avatar of Shiva honored in regional traditions, emphasizing qualities of strength, cosmic dissolution, and spiritual guidance.</li>
      <li>If there are local rituals, festivals, or temples dedicated to Shivalnath in your area, describe them here to reflect your unique traditions.</li>
      <li>Highlight attributes that distinguish him from other forms of Shiva in your community.</li>
      <li>If you have special stories, hymns, or customs, they can be added for greater depth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you’d like a more detailed write-up, consider sharing specific legends or practices from your locality!</p>
